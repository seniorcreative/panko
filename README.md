### Greetings

This is my personal folio / pseudo consultancy side gig project. I made this with NextJS14 and tailwind. It has given me the opportunity to flex my FE coding muscles while I'm in transit.
It's packed with a few little goodies like particles (css transitions), transitions (animeJS), SVG animations, a CMS with raw JSON, no-reload localization using context providers, font icons from google. It gets deployed with netlify.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
